# LIA — Locally Integrated Artificial Intelligence

A companion that runs entirely on your machine. No API keys, no accounts, and
nothing leaves the laptop once the models are pulled.

## Setup

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull the models:
   ```
   ollama pull llama3.2:3b
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```
3. Install the Python deps:
   ```
   pip install -r LIA/requirements.txt
   ```

## Running her

**As a background app** — no window, lives in the system tray, listens on the
open mic:

```powershell
pythonw LIA\app.py
```

**In a terminal** — same companion, but you can type to her as well as talk:

```powershell
python LIA\main.py
```

**As a packaged .exe** — no Python needed on the machine:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File LIA\build_exe.ps1
```

Builds `dist\Lia\Lia.exe` (~366 MB). Ollama still has to be installed separately;
the language model is far too large to bundle.

To have her start when you log in:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File LIA\autostart.ps1 install       # tray app
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File LIA\autostart.ps1 install -Exe  # packaged exe
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File LIA\autostart.ps1 install -Console
```

`remove` and `status` do what you'd expect. With no console, everything she
prints goes to `lia.log` beside the exe (or in the project root from source).

She waits for Ollama on startup and launches it if it isn't running — at login
she almost always wins the race, and without that she'd crash every boot.

## Talking to her

**Say her name to start:** *"Lia, are you there?"* After she answers you have
`CONVERSATION_WINDOW_SECONDS` (60 by default) to keep talking normally without
repeating her name. Each reply resets the window; after it lapses she goes back
to ignoring the room until you say "Lia" again.

The wake word is matched on the transcript rather than a dedicated model, so it
needs no training and tolerates Whisper's spellings — "Leah", "Lea", "Liya" all
count. Say `/wake off` to make her answer everything she hears.

In the terminal you can type instead, and these commands work:

```
/voice on|off      speak replies out loud
/mic on|off        listen at all
/openmic on|off    open mic vs push-to-talk
/wake on|off       only answer when you say her name
/voices            list installed voices
/help              command list
bye                end the session
```

**Interrupting her:** just start talking. The mic stays open while she speaks,
and anything it hears is checked against what she's currently saying — her own
voice coming back through the speakers is ignored, yours cuts her off. Clean on
headphones; on speakers it depends on how much of her voice the mic picks up.
Set `BARGE_IN = False` to go back to letting her finish.

**Spoken instructions** do something rather than becoming conversation:

```
"Lia, stop listening"   /  "go to sleep"      → mic off
"Lia, start listening"  /  "wake up"          → mic on
"Lia, be quiet"         /  "stop talking"     → voice off
"Lia, you can talk"                           → voice on
```

Edit `SPOKEN_COMMANDS` in `config.py` to add your own phrasings.

## Giving her things to read

Drop `.pdf`, `.txt` or `.md` files into `LIA\library\` (or `dist\Lia\library\`
for the packaged app). She indexes them on startup, or right away with
`/library scan`. `/library` lists what she's read.

She retrieves *passages*, not whole documents, and cites the file and page. Ask
about something specific and she'll find it; ask her to summarise a 300-page book
and she'll only see the few passages that matched. Indexing costs about half a
second per passage, once per file. Scanned PDFs won't work — there's no OCR.

## How she remembers

Three layers, all in `lia_memory.db` (plain SQLite, in the project root — inspect
it any time with `sqlite3 lia_memory.db`):

- **facts** — durable things about you, pulled out at the end of each session and
  injected into every system prompt
- **memories** — every turn, embedded, searched by cosine similarity. Only *your*
  turns are retrieved; hers competing for the same slots made her quote her own
  speculation back as fact.
- **diary** — a short private reflection she writes when a conversation ends

A conversation ends when you say `bye`, or on its own after `IDLE_MINUTES` of
silence — an always-on companion never gets a goodbye, and without the timeout
she'd never learn anything.

## The files

| file | what it does |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | every prompt and tunable. **Edit this first** if her tone feels off. |
| `db.py` | SQLite schema and queries |
| `llm.py` | Ollama wrapper — chat, streaming chat, embeddings |
| `memory.py` | embedding, retrieval, fact extraction and sanitising |
| `diary.py` | end-of-session reflection |
| `voice.py` | text-to-speech, speech recognition, voice activity detection |
| `main.py` | the conversation loop |
| `app.py` | tray app wrapper for running her in the background |
| `library.py` | reads PDFs and notes you drop in `library/` |
| `voices/` | drop your own voice files here — see `voices/README.md` |
| `library/` | drop PDFs here — see `library/README.md` |

## Tuning

| setting | when to change it |
|---|---|
| `NUM_CTX` | 8192 keeps her mostly on the GPU on a 4GB card. Ollama's 32k default spills 63% to CPU. Check with `ollama ps`. |
| `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` | `"30m"` avoids a 9s cold start; costs ~3.7GB of VRAM held. Lower it on battery. |
| `VAD_SILENCE_SECONDS` | raise if she cuts you off mid-thought |
| `VAD_THRESHOLD` | raise if background noise triggers her |
| `MIC_SETTLE_SECONDS` | raise if she answers her own voice (headphones fix this outright) |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `small.en` gets names right that `base.en` garbles |
| `IDLE_MINUTES` | how long a silence ends the conversation |

## Not built yet

- A wake word, so she isn't listening to every conversation in the room
- Barge-in — interrupting her by talking rather than Ctrl+C
- Merging duplicate facts (`sister_name` and `visiting_sister_name` both exist)
- Any way to make her forget something
